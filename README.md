# DevDigitizer Project (Sanskrit OCR)

The DevDigitizer project is focused on building a robust and accurate Optical Character Recognition Software to facilitate digitization of soiled and Ancient sanskrit manuscripts (Devanagari Script). The Sanskrit OCR is a Deep learning framework and is developed in Python. 

**The**  **Aim**  of the DevDigitizer project is to facilitate digitization and preservation of ancient indian texts on Science, Math, Literature, Poetry etc... written in Sanskrit (Devanagari Script). Digitization of ancient Manuscripts will increase the ease of access to these documents for further research and study.

# Installation
